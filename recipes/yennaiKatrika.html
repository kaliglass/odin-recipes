    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> <strong>Ennai Katrika</strong> is I would say rather a <em>underrated</em> dish in the South-Indian cuisine,It can be used as a side-dish to a wide range of main-courses like biryani
        and sambar rice(previous recipe flashbacks) to simply rice.It is basically the eggplant, fried with oil and masala to make our mouth drool.
