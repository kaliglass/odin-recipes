    <!-- Description of the dish -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p></p>When you go to a restaurant for a celebratory dinner, there is one dish which always finds a place in your order. It is the <em>rich, creamy, Paneer Butter Masala.</em> There aren't many dishes that are popular with vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.
    Everything about this desi delicacy is celebratory. The mild sweetness and tanginess from tomatoes and onions; richness of butter, cashew nuts and cream; combined with the subtle aromas from dry spices; married together by the aromatic kasuri methi and soft, yet crumbly texture of paneer - <strong>it's pure, <em>divine Indian food</em> at its best!.</strong>

    <!-- Ingredients of the dish -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 grams paneer (cottage cheese)</li>
        <li>3 onions</li>
        <li>3 tomatoes</li>
        <li>10 Cashew nuts</li>
        <li>1 inch ginger,4 - 5 pods garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon coriander powder, 1 tablespoon kashmiri chili powder, 1/4 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf, 3 cloves, 3 cardamom, 1 inch cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kasuri methi leaves (dry fenugreek), 2 - 3 sprigs coriander leaves</li>
        <li>To taste salt, 2 tablespoons butter, 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh cream</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Working Steps -->
    <h2>Working Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop the onions and tomatoes. Soak the cashew nuts in water.</li>
        <li>Heat some oil in a pan, and add the chopped onions.</li>
        <li>Cook till they are tender. As soon as the onions turn translucent, add the chopped tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Add salt, and mix well.</li>
        <li>Close the lid, and cook for 3 minutes on a low flame.</li>
        <li>Open the lid, and add coriander powder, chili powder, garam masala, and cashew nuts.</li>
        <li>Stir well, cook till the juices start to disappear, and switch off.</li>
        <li>Let it cool. Transfer the onion and tomato mixture to a blender, add a cup of water, and grind to a fine paste.</li>
        <li>Now this is the "masala" of our paneer butter masala. Add more water if the masala it's too thick.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan, and melt the butter.</li>
        <li>Fry the dry spices, bay leaf, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon, for 1 minute on a low flame.</li>
        <li>Crush the ginger and garlic, and add to the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the masala to the pan, add more chili powder (if required) for the colour, and mix well.</li>
        <li>Cook with the lid closed for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Open the lid, and cook for some more time if you want to reduce the gravy. Add the paneer cubes and the Kasuri methi leaves.</li>
        <li>Add some cream and mix well.</li>
        <li>Garnish with coriander leaves and a pinch of methi leaves. Serve hot with roti or naan.</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Notes -->
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use only Kashmiri chili powder for this recipe - it adds a beautiful red colour to the curry  without making the masala too hot</li>
        <li>Crush the ginger and garlic to make a coarse paste before drying in butter. I used a mortar and pestle. Crushing them on the chopping board with the flat surface of your knife will do fine</li>
        <li>Kasuri methi adds a welcome bitter note to the sweet flavours of paneer butter masala. But be careful not to overdo it. Too much methi leaves will make your curry taste bitter!</li>
    </ul>
